# fight_game_robot

This is a game robot that moves with kinect. I'm planning to turn it to a full video-game-arcade with two robots fighting.

I guess it will be fun, alot of people didn't interact with real robots yet. I saw some amazing interactions from people who played with this game, it's really different when it's not just a screen character in a video game. Also, if it was built with gaming experience in mind, it would have the potential to sell.
